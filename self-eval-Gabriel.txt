# Questions about the programming project
Worth mentioning on before hand. Since the project had two sub-goals and we initially divided up ourselves in sub-groups. 
So when one of us was undisposable we could still carry on. 

## Which parts of the programming project were you actively involved in? Please note which parts you did yourself and which parts you did together with others (and who they were).
I was very dedicated in the Interpreter section. Both making the basic one with only the "any"-quantifier work and the difficult one to handle all the quantifiers. Also in the end I was working on the post-processing part when Parser.Result began containing a list of {Step} insted of just strings. It was just a partial refactoration to reach a more readable setup.

## Which parts of the programming project were you not actively involved in?
I Was not actively involved in the Planner until the end period. I still knew where the development was headed but I did not contribute in creating the initial heuristics. 

## Do you think that some or several in the group (including you) deserve a higher or lower grade than the others, for the programming project? Who would that be and why?
Personally, I sincerely think that we all should have the same grade. There were moments when Niklas was elsewhere but since the project has in overall moved on in a good pace and when we had some trouble he contributed. 

# Questions about the essay
Worth mentioning on before hand. We found our sources early on and everyone needed to read them before we could sit down and find our approach. 

## Which parts of the essay were you actively involved in? Please note which parts you did yourself and which parts you did together with others (and who they were).
In the beginning I started off writing some ideas on how to structure the whole essays and aided us finding our writing style. 
I started off writing on a section regarding Bostroms theory of simulating consciousness by simulating everything. But since the essay had taken a turn for the better we cut that part.
In the end game I was involved in improving the content and formulations of section 2 (all subsections), 3, 5 and 6.
