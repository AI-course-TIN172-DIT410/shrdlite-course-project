## Bowald

- [The Nature, Importance, and Difficulty of Machine Ethics](http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/ex/2006/04/x4018-abs.html) 
  - Argues that as we expand computers decision making roles in practical matters, such as computer driving cars, ethical considerations are inevitable
  - Humans can not in retreat to a world of pure facts, or lace subjective normative assessment. Computers can!
  - four types of ethics
    - **Ethical-impact agents**, Gives an example of camel jockey, where young boys was enslaved to ride camels. This problem was solved by replacing the boys with robots. It had an impact on this specific case, but not on the slavery.
    - **Implicit ethical agents** Support ethical or avoid unethical behavior, rather than programing explicit ethical maxims.
    - **Explicit ethical agents** Refers to a specific ethical logic that could be the solution for ethical decisions. Also another work on two models, that helps machine learn from their decisions in an ethical manner is referred to. 
    - **Full ethical agents** Arguments against computer decisions: Only fully ethical agents can be ethical agents. 
  - Suggest DARPA should make a challenge of Explicit ethical agents, like they did with autonomous-vehicle project
  - Argues that even if their is decisions of life and death, and if a computer could make more routinely decisions which saves more lives. Would we not let them do that? Suggest this could be a good ethical basis for letting computers to make ethical decisions.
  - Argues that we should focus on developing limited explicit ethical agents. Even if they never can be fully ethical agents, they can prevent unethical outcomes.
- [Why the future doesnâ€™t need us.](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html)
  Lots of pages, none of them relevant for us.
- [Automated ethics(Bergman link)](http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/can-we-design-systems-to-automate-ethics/)
  - The human beings is unperfected by progress of technology, makes an example of safer cars, but still millions of people die in traffic.
  - Trolley problem, save 5 or 1 life by switching lanes on a subway. Argument for logic reasoning, better save 5 lives, then one. Humans could panic in these situations.
  - Another example, but this case murder 1 innocent(fat man) and save 5 or let 1 live and five dies in an accident. Even if the first case is better, a solution that would require a murder is not a good one. Consequentialism looks at the consequences and by this ideology first case would be chosen. Deontology looks at the path to a solutions, in this case murder. Therefore pick the second solution. 
  - Argues that the right algorithm can itself be an ethical superior entity to us, by combining Consequentialism and Deontology in a way we cant.
  - "Society has been savouring the fruits of automation since well before the industrial revolution and, whether you are devout utilitarian or a sceptical deontologist, the gains in everything from leisure and wealth to productivity and health have been vast.
