put the black ball on the floor - gör onödiga saker
put all boxes on the floor - resulterar i felaktig

when "don't pick up from empty" and "disable balls on balls" is activated:
-------------------------------------------
How to reproduce:
"put the black ball on the white ball" x 2 => "TypeError: Cannot read property 'form' of undefined", UH OH

Problem:
In step 7, the robot tries to lift from stack 4 when it's empty. Why!? That node should not exist, since I added the "don't pick up from empty" rule.

Additional information:
In step 2 to 3, e disappears from stack 4.
The 'bot probably believes that e is still there, hence the confusion
It either lifts e from state 0/1, or lifts two things from state 2

In step 7, e reappears when we pick it up from stack 4.
