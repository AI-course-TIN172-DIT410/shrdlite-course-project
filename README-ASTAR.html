      A* Laboration <br>
      Group 10 (Traveling salesmen O(n)) - Simon Lindhén, Johan Nilsson Hansen, Alexander Persson
    </p>
    <p>
      How to run:
      Follow the instructions further down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important files:
      <ul>
      <li>AStar.ts       - The TypeScript file with our implementation of the A* search algorithm.</li>
      <li>collections.ts - The data structure library we have chosen to utilize. 
                           Defines the PriorityQueue class necessary for implementing A*.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: <br>
      Our example is a geographical one, involving several Swedish cities and the connections
      between them. The cities are modeles as nodes in a graph, and the connections are
      represented as the archs connecting the nodes. The distance between the cities act
      as arch costs, and as such the cost of a path is the sum of all arch costs along the path.
      The heuristic value associated to each node is the an underestimate of the remaining cost to get from
      that city to the goal. The starting city is Göteborg and the goal city is Stockholm.

    <h2>You have not compiled AStar yet</h2>
    <p>To compile the A* files run: tsc --module commonjs AStar.ts. Then refresh the page.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="suchAstar">
    <h2>You have compiled AStar.</h2>
    <p>To run the test and see the result, open your browser console and press the button below. The path found will be output to the log.</p>
    <button onclick="console.log(AStar.geoTest()); ">Run the geo test.</button>
