<strong><h2>README-ASTAR</h2></strong>
 
To test our program you run the command below which will create a javascript file called example.js.<br>
<i>tsc --out example.js example.ts</i><br><br>
Then you should open the <i>AStar.html</i> file in the web browser. <br><br>
There you have three buttons, one for each example. Click on the example you would like to run.<br><br>

<hr>

<strong>Description of each file:<br></strong>
- AStar.ts <br>
Contains the AStar-algortihm and everything that's needed to create a graph (nodes, arches, heuristics etc). <br><br>
- Example.ts<br>
Contains the three examples which tests our AStar algortihm. <br><br>
- AStar.html<br>
Run this file to test all examples in the web browser. <br><br>

<strong>Basic example:<br></strong>
This is a very simple example that doesn't use heuristics and therefore becomes the lowest cost algorithm. <br> <br>

Start city: 1 <br>
Final city: 3 <br><br>

<strong>Example1:<br></strong>
This example is from the lecture slides (chapter 3, page 49) which is a non-trivial heuristics test. <br>
It's about distances to some cities and their heuristics values. The test shows that the AStar-algorithm actually <br> 
gets the lowest cost to the city (since the city can been reach from two different paths in the graph, see picture below).<br><br>

Start city: Arad <br>
Final city: Bucharest <br><br>

<strong>Example2:<br></strong>
We have invented this example by ourself. This examples is also about distances to some cites and their heuristics values and is <br>
therefore like the example above but here it's a possiblity to reach other cities after the final city.<br><br>

Start city: GÃ¶teborg <br>
Final city: Stockholm <br>
