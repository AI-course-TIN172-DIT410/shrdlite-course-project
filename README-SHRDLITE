Running the program
-------------------
Run 'make all' and open shrdlite.html in your browser.

Extentions
----------
None

Heuristics for A*
-----------------
The heuristics looks at the distance from the current position of the arm to the
position of the targeted. Additionaly the heuristics also take into account any
overlaying object when our goal is picking up or dropping objects.
You can find the heuristics in Planner.ts.

Stange behaviours
-----------------
We started implementing an extention for disambiguating interpretations of
utterances but we did not finish it on time. This could possibly lead to some 
stange behavior. Otherwise we have not seen any stange or unexpected behavior
when running the program.
