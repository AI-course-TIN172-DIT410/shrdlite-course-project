Formalisation of heuristic in WorldStates, the minimum defined moves needed for each goal.

x is on top of y if it is directly on top â€“ the same relation is called inside if y is a box.
	Remove each object that is above y, and remove each object above x but not above y.
	Pick up x.
	Move arm to y's stack.
	Drop x.


x is above y if it is somewhere above.
	Remove each object above x.
	Pick up x.
	Move arm to y's stack.
	Drop x.

x is under y if it is somewhere below.
	Remove each object above y.
	Pick up y.
	Move arm to x's stack.
	Drop y.

x is beside y if they are in adjacent stacks.
	Remove each object above x or y, choosing the one with the smallest overhead.
	Pick up chosen one.
	Move to closest adjacent stack of other one.
	Drop chosen one.

x is left of y if it is somewhere to the left.
	Remove each object above x or y, choosing the one with the smallest overhead.
	Pick up chosen one.
	Move to left adjacent stack of other one.
	Drop chosen one.

x is right of y if it is somewhere to the right.
	Remove each object above x or y, choosing the one with the smallest overhead.
	Pick up chosen one.
	Move to right adjacent stack of other one.
	Drop chosen one.
