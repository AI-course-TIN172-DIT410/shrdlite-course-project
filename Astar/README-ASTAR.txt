What should be in README-ASTAR?

The file README-ASTAR should contain information about how to test your implementation on your example(s), plus a description of each file that are important for this lab. Furthermore, it should contain a description of the example(s) and the heuristics that you have used.


Test: run make, then open test.html

Files:
	astar.ts - the actual algorithm
	graph.ts - graph representation
	example.ts - for testing
	collections.ts - library for collections ( not created by us)

Examples: 
	one example comes from lecture 2, the romania example!
	the other on is just randomly choosen to test another input type!

Heuristics:
