The example test environment is a grid where one can choose the grid size, and the start, goal and invalid locations. Once the grid system is set up, a shortest path is found using A*. Heuristic is the Manhattan distance to the goal.

FILES:
Paths_in_grids.js: the code for setting up the A* problem and implementations of functions used by AStar.js
AStar.js: the algorithm code
Sets.js: we needed an implementation of sets for the algorithm
Paths_in_grids.css&.html: the web code

<!-- The file README-ASTAR should contain information about how to test your implementation on your example(s), plus a description of each file that are important for this lab. Furthermore, it should contain a description of the example(s) and the heuristics that you have used. -->
