A STAR IMPLEMENTATION
======================

Examples has been integrated with the shrdlite-offline.ts file 
use by typing "node shrdlite-offline.js ASTAR #city-to-start-from"

To implement this lab we chose to have a single file for the A* algorithm which holds all interesting functions that are needed.

As heuristics we are using the direct path from the cities to the city of Bucharest.
See image below.
