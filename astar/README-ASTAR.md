## How to build and run
Just compile as normal using the typescript compiler.
```
> tsc AStar.ts
```
You can run the test cases by opening the file *index.html*.
Look in the console for output.

## Description of important files
### AStar.ts
This is the main file of the lab. Notable classes and functions include the following:
##### Classes
 * _Node_ - Represents a node in the graph. Contains a string label, its neighbours, the cost of the path to this node and a possible pointer to the previous node for creating a path. Also contains utility function for creating many nodes quickly.
 * _Edge_ - Represents an edge between nodes. Contains a start node, an end node and the cost between them. Has utility functions for creating many edges and complement/reverse edges.
 * _Heap_ - Used as a priority queue, to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. Copied from _collections_ to be able to use our own compare function.

##### Functions
 * _astar_ - This is the function that does calculates the best path given a graph and a heuristic function. The heuristic function takes a node and gives its heuristic value. No heuristic computation is done in this function. The function could either be complex, or just a lookup table of values. Other than using a priority queue to reduce complexity, this A* is a straight forward implementation of its definition.
 * _test_ - Logs whether a test succeded ot failed.

### TestCases.ts
This file contains all the test cases. See subsection _Test cases_.

### index.html
This file runs the test cases.

### collections.js
Used for implementing a compare interface for use with the heap.

## Test cases
We currently have 1 test case.

Test case 1 consists of 8 nodes, as seen in *figure 1*. It contains a start node and a goal node
labeled *a* and *d* respectively. This test case has two main purposes. The first is to test that
the heuristic does its job, by luring the algorithm towards the node *f*. If the heuristic works
as intended, the algorithm should choose either node *b* or *e* instead, since they are closer to
the goal node. The second purpose for this test case is to check that the algorithm chooses the
correct/shortest path, which is *(a -> b -> c -> d)*. The heuristics for all the nodes are:

| Label  | Heuristic |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| a | 3 |
| b | 2 |
| c | 1 |
| d | 0 |
| e | 4 |
| f | 3.5 |
| g | 4.5 |
| h | 4.5 |
