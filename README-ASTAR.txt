The A* algorithm is contained in the source file astar.ts.
In order to run the test suite, you'll need to compile the tests with the following command.

tsc --out Astartests.js Astartests.ts

The tests can then be run using node:

node Astartests.js


The algorithm makes use of the typescript-collections library.
