ASTAR ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION
==============================

The implementation of Astar has been done in Java.
Their are three files associated to this algorithm:
(Stored in src/)

-AbstractNode.java: Contains an abstract class that describes the structure of a generic 
		    node in the search algorithm should look like. Also contains the Astar
		    generic implementation of the Astar algorithm for <? extends AbstractNode> class type.
		    Contains the abstract method for the heuristic that should be used when doing 
		    the search.

-GraphNode.java: An example of what a children class of AbstractNode could look like.
		 In this case it is used to represent a weighted graph.
		 The heuristic implemented is the Euclidean distance between two nodes.

-Main.java: File to be executed. 
	    Contains two example of an Astar search on a weighted graph.
