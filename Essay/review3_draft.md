# Essay 3 - Review



A sound introduction to various types of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and how they have progresses from an historical point of view in the introductory part. This gives the reader a perspective on the achievments in this field. The societal effects of these achievements could be briefly elaborated on a bit. The general introduction seems decoupled from the rest of the text which focuses on **autonomous cars** instead of vehicles in general. Some interesting questions are posed which sparks interest in further reading and most/all of them are later discussed in the text.  Lacks a proper introduction/description of what an artificial intelligence (AI) is, e.g. how advanced it might be or how it has evolved from an historical point of view. Contains some redundancy such as multiple mentionings of what the paper aims at presenting. Further, contains discussions on the "risk" of loosing jobs and changes in infrastructure which is later repeated in section 3.

Section 2 describes a lot of facts and seems to exclusively describe the specs. and implementation of Googles autonomous cars. If the intention is to illustrate an example of a product in this field, that should be emphasised in the title/introduction to this section. The detailed description does, however, serve as a good overview of the different technologies used but is somewhat vague when it comes to describing the AI. The discussion on the necessity of thourough testing in such safety critical systems introduces an important question.

Section 3 starts of with a somewhat confusing introduction that might (most likely should) be reformulated. The societal impacts are discussed from multiple topics such as changes with respect to environmental, behavioural, infrastructural and safety aspects and seems to cover a lot of the spectrum. Perhaps add a discussion on which scenarios that are most likely occur and why. Impacts with respect to legal issues merely covers the most obvious aspect and might be elaborated on with questions like: who is to blame if an AV would break any trafic laws, e.g. speeding or faulty parking. Another aspect might be the potential violation of privacy with respect to the vehicles camera systems. Finally the discussion on the possibility of a (potential) teardown of large institutions and vechicle manufacturers is interesting and the mentioning of the classical fear of losing ones job to the "droids" (that almost surely is included in most text on the subject) is a must.

The concluding section is consistent with the text and present the authors own conclusions on the subject. It does, however, introduce new discussions on the effects of the adoption of the autopilot in aircrafts and ideas on the decreased market value of non-autonomous cars which might/would be a better fit in the main body of the text. Some conclusions on the possibilities/threats of intelligent decision making might also be added if this is introduces in a greater extent in the revised text.

In general, there are some sentence structures and spelling errors that could be improved upon with a few proof readings.
