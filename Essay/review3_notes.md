# Essay 3 - Notes 

# General

- The language used is on a moderate level with a some "bad" sentences and misspellings.
- The introduction gives the impression that the text will deliver an overview of autonomous vehicles "in a general sense" but fails to deliver this 
  and seems to focus mostly on autonoums cars, especially Googles autonomous car.. could for example discuss AGVs in production industry?
- Fails in describing the AI, mostly comments that "it" need to make intelligent decisions..




# Notes during read through


### 1. Introduction

#####  pros.

- good intention of describing the history of autonomous vehicles, and adding a few examples of various kinds of autonomous vechicles.
- Poses concrete questions that (hopefully) will be answered: legal issues, employment, infrastructure, intelligent decision making.
- Introduces a standard for measuring autonomousy

##### cons.

- No elaboration on the societal effects the historical examples of autonomous vehicles had at the time of their development.
- Multiple mentionings of what the paper will present, e.g. the state of the art in autonomous vehicles and their impact on society.
- No general description of what AI is.. unclear in this context, needed to process sensor data and make decisions, how advanced?
- Elaboration on the probable impact on the risk of "losing" a lot of jobs and changes in infrastructure that is repeated in section 3.  


### 2. State of the Art

##### pros.

- good if the idea is to give a bulletlist of the specs. of Googles car.

##### cons. 

- Seems like a description of the specs. of Googles self driving car, not a general overview of the state of the art as the section title might indicate, Emphasize that this is - an example - of a state of the art autonomous car. 
- Again need to elaborate on the functionality of the AI..  
- No discussion or comments, merely stating facts


#### 2.1. Sensors and the AI 

#####  pros.

- Detailed explanations of the workings and purpose of each component of Googles Toyota, gives a good insight of what the technology consists of but...

#####  cons.

- … on the other hand it fails to deliver a general overview and is merely stating the specs of a specific example.


#### 2.2. Experiments and Practical Tests

#####  pros.

- Exposes the necessity of thourough testing in safety critical systems.

##### cons.

- no description of abbrevation AVs, (autonomous vehicles) **
- Referrs to section 2.1 as Chapter **
- No elaboration on other companies work, again only "facts" about Googles tests



### 3. Possible Impacts 

##### cons.

- Somewhat confusing intro..

#### 3.1 Societal Impact

##### pros.

- Good elaboration on environmental gains/(losses), changes in behaviour/infrastructure and the safety aspect

##### cons.

- No argument to which are the most likely scenarios?

#### 3.2 Legal Issues

##### pros.

- Statements on the attitude from different manufacturers, makes for a more general view, good!.

##### cons.

- A bit thin, only one issu is being discussed:  "who is responsible if an accident should occur"? Might elaborate on other legal issues e.g. 
  - what if the car breaks traffic laws? e.g. speeding or faulty parking (in the case of a car dropping you at the door and then goes of to find a parking space). Who is responsible?
  - Regulations regarding the vechicles camera systems violating privacy? etc. 


#### 3.3 Economic Impact

##### pros.

- Pointing out the effect (possible teardown) of large institutions and manufacturers
- The possibly large amount of jobs that might be replaced

##### cons.

- ​

### Conclusions

##### pros.

- Most conclusions consisten with that discussed in the text

##### cons.

- Makes a parallell to the effects of the autopilot in aircrafts, not discussed in the paper, but could have been elaborated on in the introduction.
- Same with the decrease in cost of a "regular" car.
- Thin on intelligent decision making/AI?
